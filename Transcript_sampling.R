# Implementation of the SlideSeq DGE method. The general idea 
#  is to, for each gene, first calculate the distribution of distances
#  between the spots in which it is expressed. In the paper by 
#  Rodriques et al. (Science 363, 1463â€“1467, 2019. 
#  doi 10.1126/science.aaw1219) 1000 random samples of the same number
#  of spots are then obtained, by sampling spots using probabilities
#  proportional to the total number of transcripts captured in each
#  spot, without replacement. For each such set of random spots, 
#  the distribution of distances between the spots is calculated, and 
#  the element-wise mean of the 1000 distributions is taken to obtain 
#  a mean distribution. The difference between the real distribution 
#  and the mean distribution as well as between each of the random 
#  samples and the mean distribution is calculated. The L1 norm of 
#  these difference vectors is then used as the test statistic, to 
#  determine whether the gene in question has a non-random spatial
#  distribution.
# 1. Initially implemented without any adaptations to ST, working with
#     raw count data, and using spot coordinates for the distances.
# 2. Optimization of the code, including not sampling anew for every
#     gene. The genes that are expressed in the same number of spots
#     are grouped together, and the same set of 1000 random sets
#     of spots are used for all of the genes within such a group.
# 3. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is included for MHT correction.
#     N.B.: Do these tests really satisfy the criterion of
#     independence or positive dependence? If no, the 
#     Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure can be applied (code included),
#     but with 1000 random samples all obtained p-values are too large
#     for this to work...
# 4. Attempt to introduce weighting according to the expression level
#     of the gene in question, in order to step away from the binary
#     approach employed in the original SlideSeq method. In order to
#     get a representative background, the idea is to sample the same
#     number of spots (with replacement) as the total number of 
#     transcripts of a specific gene, instead of the number of spots
#     where there is any transcription at all.
# --> This doesn't seem to work very well, since it seems to be a
#     general feature of the method that the more spots are to be 
#     sampled, the more (presumably false) positives will be obtained.
# --> Attempt 2: Try to use log10(counts) rather than raw counts.
# --> The same problem, could it be due to the replacement?

#  distribution and the mean distribution are saved in diff_matr_rand.
#  The L1 norms of these differences are saved in L1_norms_rand.
#  The genes are then taken one by one. First, the indices of the
#  non-zero elements are obtained, i.e. the spots where the gene in
#  question is expressed. This is used to obtain the distances, which
#  are saved in eukl. The difference between the distribution of 
#  these distances (in the same bins as the random distributions)
#  and the mean distance are calculated, the L1 norm is calculated 
#  (L1_norm_real), and the p-value is calculated as 
#  p=(no random samples with L1>L1(true sample))/(total no random 
#  samples). If the numerator is equal to 0, it can however only
#  be said that p<1/n. These cases are currently saved as p=1/(10n).
#  In the supplementary material to the paper by Rodriques et al. 
#  it is stated that p=(no random samples with L1<L1(true sample))/
#  (total no random samples), but this contradicts their 
#  argumentation, as well as the example in figure S10.
